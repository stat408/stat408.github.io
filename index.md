## Course Schedule

The course will be taught from a partially flipped perspective. Tuesdays will be lectures with an interactive computing component. Thursdays will be group labs which focus on implementing the programming covered during the previous week. As much of the course time will be focused on group activities and active learning, video lectures with a particular focus on computational techniques will be created to be watched out of class.

A rough course schedule will be:

(5 weeks) R: Intro to R, R Studio, and R Markdown. Data input, cleaning, and merging.
(6 weeks) Data Visualization Principles and Advanced R: ggplot2, RShiny, and statistical modeling.
(4 weeks) SAS: data storage, manipulation, SAS procedures, and SAS macros.

## Course Policies


#### Grading Policy

Course Evaluation:

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by weekly homework assignments. Students are allowed and encouraged to work with classmates on homework assignments, but each student is required to complete their own homework. Homework will be collected through D2L and will be due prior to class on Thursdays. 

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a Labs. Labs will be in-class group assignments conducted every Thursday. The labs will have a large computational element. The labs will be designed to be completed in 75 minutes; however, there may be times that groups need to finish labs outside of class time.

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm exam. The midterm exam will have two parts: an in class exam and a take home portion.

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam. The final exam will have two parts: an in class exam and a take home portion.

#### Collaboration
University policy states that, unless otherwise specified, students may not collaborate on graded material. Any exceptions to this policy will be stated explicitly for individual assignments. If you have any questions about the limits of collaboration, you are expected to ask for clarification.

In this class students are encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but exams should be completed without collaboration.

####  Academic Misconduct
Section 420 of the Student Conduct Code describes academic misconduct as including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, multiple submissions, or facilitating othersâ€™ misconduct. Possible sanctions for academic misconduct range from an oral reprimand to expulsion from the university.

#### Disabilities Policy

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities. If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation(s), you are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services and the instructor as soon as possible.
