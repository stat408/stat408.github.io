# STAT 506: Advanced Regression Analysis

## Course Description

This course will introduce linear regression, generalized linear models, and hierarchical models using the software package R. The course will emphasis reproducible research using R Markdown, version control with GitHub, and report writing.

## Learning Outcomes:

- To fit hierarchical models in R and SAS and interpret the results.
- To fit models which take into account common forms of correlation.
- To fit models which take into account common forms of non-constant variance.
- To make inference using models which do not assume normality of residuals.
- To fit Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and to interpret results.

## Prerequisites

- Required: STAT 505

## Textbooks

- _Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models_, by Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill


## Additional Resources
Analysis, data visualization, and version control procedures will be implemented with:

- R / R Studio
- Git / Github

## Course Policies


#### Grading Policy

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by weekly homework assignments. Students are allowed and encouraged to work with classmates on homework assignments, but each student is required to complete their own homework. 

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a midterm exam. The midterm exam will have two parts: an in class exam and a take home portion. The in class portions will be largely conceptual including  short mathematical derivations. The take home portions will focus on analysis of data and implementation of regression concepts.

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam. The final exam will have two parts: an in class exam and a take home portion. The in class portions will be largely conceptual including mathematical derivations. The take home portions will focus on analysis of data and implementation of regression concepts.

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by a series of projects. The projects will be due roughly every 3 - 4 weeks during the course of the semester and may require oral presentations.


#### Collaboration
University policy states that, unless otherwise specified, students may not collaborate on graded material. Any exceptions to this policy will be stated explicitly for individual assignments. If you have any questions about the limits of collaboration, you are expected to ask for clarification.

In this class students are encouraged to collaborate on homework assignments, but exams and projects should be completed without collaboration.


####  Academic Misconduct
Section 420 of the Student Conduct Code describes academic misconduct as including but not limited to plagiarism, cheating, multiple submissions, or facilitating othersâ€™ misconduct. Possible sanctions for academic misconduct range from an oral reprimand to expulsion from the university.

#### Disabilities Policy

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level to qualified students with disabilities. If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an accommodation(s), you are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible.
